# SMART-AGRICULTURE-USING-REAL-TIME-MONITORING-AND-AUTOMATION
This project leverages a cloud based machine learning model, deployed using Flask, to predict the suitability of environmental conditions for 22 unique crops.
The model analyzes key environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, pH, and sunlight exposure to determine if they are conducive to the healthy growth of a specific crop. The model was trained on a dataset of 2201 records compiled from [sources, e.g., agricultural databases, research institutions, publicly available weather data]. A random forest model was trained to predict crop suitability. The model achieved a preliminary accuracy of 95.6 on a held-out test set. A user-friendly interface allows users to select a specific crop and input relevant environmental data to receive a suitability prediction. This tool can assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection and planting schedules, leading to increased yields and more efficient resource utilization. Future work will focus on expanding the model to include more crops and incorporating real-time weather data.
Here we apply machine learning for real time monitoring.
Whole infastucture is cloud based for its scalablity and reliablity.
